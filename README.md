Railsponsibility - Arrivals monitor
===================================

The [original Railsponsibility project](https://github.com/Digital-Contraptions-Imaginarium/railsponsibility) was becoming too big and cumbersome, slowing down development. A key functionality of the whole package is monitoring the trains' arrival, even without building any functionality on top of it. It was worth it dedicating a project to that only and making the original Railsponsibility dependant on this.
